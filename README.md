Arithmetic expression evaluator that works by representing expressions as a tree. Numbers and operators are different classes, but implement the same interface (ArithmeticExpression). Each operator class has a left and right operand which is a class implementing ArithmeticExpression. This forms a tree structure. Nothing groundbreaking here but demonstrates the OOP principle of the compound pattern.
